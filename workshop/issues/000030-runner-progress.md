# runner progress reporting — SizeHint + progress callback (k/n + live outer-cv)

## Problem

A sweep runs blind. `titanic-sweep.md` is **495** per-fold runs (`driver: single`, 99 configs × 5
folds) and **2,475** for the honest `driver: cv` (× 5 outer) — with no live signal of how far along it
is or what it's finding. The operator wants **`k / n`** (k = points completed, n = total) **plus the
running estimate** (best-so-far / outer-cv). For grid, n is exact; for adaptive samplers (future: bayes,
racing) n may be a budget or genuinely unknown — so n must be allowed to be `?`, with k + the incumbent
still reported.

## Spec

The `pkg/sampler` **ask/tell `Run` loop already sees everything needed** — it fires a `Tell` per
completed point (that's k) and holds the accumulator `S` (which carries the incumbent / per-outer-fold
gather = the live outer-cv). Two additions, no new runner (see the metis-v2 runner design in
`workshop/pensive/` / the kbench#8 discussion — grid and adaptive share one `Run`):

1. **`SizeHint` on the `Sampler` interface** — `SizeHint(s S) (total int, kind SizeKind)` where
   `SizeKind ∈ {exact, budget, unknown}`. The static/grid sampler returns `(∏ grid, exact)`; a
   fixed-eval sampler returns `(maxEvals, budget)`; an open-ended one returns `(_, unknown)`. This is
   the ONLY per-sampler bit — the varying "n" pushed into the interface, not a runner branch.
2. **A `progress` callback injected into `Run`** (alongside the existing `runPoint` closure, ARCH-PURE)
   — `progress(ev ProgressEvent)` called on each `Tell` with `{level, k, total, kind, incumbent}`. Nesting
   composes: the driver level reports outer-fold progress + the live outer-cv from its accumulator; the
   sweeper level reports inner-config progress. `Run` stays pure over the injected callback.
3. **`cmd/metis` renders it** — a single aggregated line (NOT a 2,475-line firehose — respect the
   single-threaded-attention budget): e.g. `outer 2/5 · inner 47/99 · est 0.812 ± 0.02` for nested,
   `47/99 · best 0.834` for a flat sweep, `47/? · best 0.834` for an unknown-budget sampler.

Injected `progress` defaults to a no-op (backward-compatible; pure `Run` tests pass `nil`).

## Done when

- `SizeHint` on the grid sampler returns the exact config×fold product (unit-tested pure).
- `Run` invokes the injected `progress` exactly once per `Tell`, with a monotonically increasing k and
  the correct total/kind (unit-tested with a recording callback; a `nil` callback is a no-op).
- `metis run` prints a live `k/n` + running best for a grid sweep, and `outer j/k · est mean±SE` for a
  `driver: cv` run — verified on a real (or fixture) sweep, not just asserted.

## Plan

- [ ] (spec at claim) `SizeKind` + `SizeHint` on `Sampler`; grid impl; `progress` callback threaded
  through `Run` (nesting-composed); `cmd/metis` renderer (aggregated, hierarchical); tests.

## Log

### 2026-07-13
- Filed from the kbench#8 sweep-scale discussion (operator, metis-v2). The runner is already an ask/tell
  fold with one `Run` loop for grid + adaptive; progress is the `SizeHint` (n) + a per-`Tell` callback
  (k + incumbent) hung off that loop — no per-sampler runner. Sibling: metis#31 (parallel batch exec) —
  same loop, the other injected seam. Near-term / high-value (you feel the blindness at 2,475 folds).
